# Advanced Data Types

## Lists(familiar face)
- They are ordered, mutable (changeable, can add, repalce or remove) collections of items. 
- They are defined by enclosing elements in square brackets.
- Example: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", 1]

## Tuples
- They are ordered, immutable (cannot be changed, cannot add or replace) collection of items.
- They are defined by enclosing elements in perenthesis/small brackets ().

## Sets
- They are unordered collection of unique elements (canont have identical elements).
- They are useful for membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and mathematical operations like union, intersection and difference.
- Cannot access the elements using index operator []. Need to check if the elements exist in the set.
- They are defined by enclosing elements in curly brackets {}.
