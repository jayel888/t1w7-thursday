# Advanced Data Types

## Lists(familiar face)
- They are ordered, mutable (changeable, can add, repalce or remove) collections of items. 
- They are defined by enclosing elements in square brackets.
- Example: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", 1]

## Tuples
- They are ordered, immutable (cannot be changed, cannot add or replace) collection of items.
- They are defined by enclosing elements in perenthesis/small brackets ().

## Sets
- They are unordered collection of unique elements (canont have identical elements).
- They are useful for membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and mathematical operations like union, intersection and difference.
- Cannot access the elements using index operator []. Need to check if the elements exist in the set.
- They are defined by enclosing elements in curly brackets {}.

- Union: Combine sets together. Duplicates are deleted.
- Intersection: Common values between multiple sets.
- Difference: Set 1 minus the common values from Set 2. eg 1, 2, 3 & 3, 4, 5 has difference 1,2

## Dictionaries
- Collection of key-value pairs, mutable.
- Each key value is unique, and the keys are used to store and retrieve values.
