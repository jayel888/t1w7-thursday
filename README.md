# Advanced Data Types

## Lists(familiar face)
- They are ordered, mutable (changeable, can add, repalce or remove) collections of items. 
- They are defined by enclosing elements in square brackets.
- Example: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", 1]

## Tuples
- They are ordered, immutable (cannot be changed, replaced) collection of items.
- They are defined by enclosing elements in perenthesis/small brackets ().
